# 3D Models Required

This directory should contain the following 3D model files for the FluidGlass component to work properly:

- `lens.glb` - Lens/cylinder geometry for the fluid glass lens mode
- `bar.glb` - Bar geometry for the navigation bar mode  
- `cube.glb` - Cube geometry for the cube mode

## Where to get the models:

You can create these simple 3D models using:
- Blender (free)
- Any 3D modeling software that can export GLB files
- Online GLB model repositories

## Model Requirements:

- **Format**: GLB (binary GLTF)
- **Geometry names**: 
  - lens.glb should have geometry named "Cylinder"
  - bar.glb should have geometry named "Cube" 
  - cube.glb should have geometry named "Cube"
- **Scale**: Models should be reasonably sized (around 1-2 units)
- **Optimization**: Keep models simple for good performance

## Alternative:

If you don't have these models, the component will still load but may show console errors. You can:
1. Comment out the FluidGlassSection in App.js temporarily
2. Add the 3D model files when available
3. Or create simple primitive shapes exported as GLB files
